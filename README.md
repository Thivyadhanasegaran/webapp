GitHub Actions Integration Tests Workflow:

 The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow named "test-checker" specifically designed for integration testing of the /v1/user endpoint.

Workflow Description:

The workflow consists of the following steps:

• Install MySQL: Starts the MySQL service.
• Configure MySQL: Sets up the MySQL database by creating a database, user, and granting necessary privileges.
• Use Node.js: Sets up Node.js environment.
• Set up environment variables: Sets up environment variables required for the application to connect to the MySQL database.
• Install Dependencies: Installs the project dependencies using npm
• Start the application: Starts the application by running "npm start".
• Run Tests: Executes the integration tests defined in the "test" directory using the "npm test" command.

Test Environment Configuration:

The workflow utilizes secrets to securely configure the MySQL database connection. The following secrets are required:

- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Root password for MySQL.
- DB_USER: Username for the MySQL database.
- DB_PASSWORD: Password for the MySQL database user.
- DB: Name of the MySQL database.
- MYSQL_HOST: Hostname of the MySQL server.

These secrets are used to create and configure the MySQL database during workflow execution. Additionally, environment variables are set both in the workflow and in a ".env" file to ensure proper configuration of the application.

 Execution Flow:

• The workflow starts by installing and configuring MySQL to create the necessary database and user.
• Sets Node.js environment.
• Environment variables are configured to establish the connection between the application and MySQL database.
• Dependencies are installed, and the application is started.
• Integration tests are executed against the running application to validate the functionality of the "/v1/user" endpoint.

The workflow ensures that the application interacts correctly with the MySQL database and that the "/v1/user" endpoint behaves as expected according to the specified test cases.

## Assignment 04:
 
• A custom image will be created from CentOS 8 Stream and it is configured to run in the default VPC.
• This image includes dependencies such as MySQL and Node.js, along with the creation of specific user and group profiles based on given requirements  (user: csye6225, group: csye6225).
• The web application service is set to automatically start using a systemd file named webapp.service.
• Deployment of the custom image to a GCP service account requires following specific roles to be enabled
1. Compute Engine Instance Admin (v1).
2. Service Account User.
A JSON key is downloaded from the Service Account and it is stored securely as a secret in the organization's web application repository.
• Two workflows have been developed: test-build and test-checker.
• Test-checker workflow includes integration tests, building project artifacts, Packer initialization, formatting, and validation commands.
• Test-validator workflow also contains integration tests and builds project artifacts. Additionally, it includes authentication, Packer initialization, Packer building, and the creation of a custom image upon merge.

## Assignment 05:
• Packer template has been updated to remove mysql installation step in install_dependencies shell script.
• DB configuration and user creation are achieved through terraform code.


## Assignment 06:
• Updated the Packer template to include installation and configuration of the Ops Agent.
• Utilized a provisioner to install the Ops Agent by executing the provided installation script.
• Configured the Ops Agent to streamline application logs to Google Cloud Observability.

Ops Agent Configuration:
• Modified the ops-agent-config.yaml file to specify the logging configuration for application logs.
• Ensured that the configuration correctly specifies the paths to application logs and their format (JSON)
• Updated the logging configuration in the web application code to write logs in structured JSON format.
• Utilized libraries like Winston to format logs in JSON and ensure compatibility with Google Cloud Observability.
• Adjusted logging statements within the application code to generate structured logs.
• Ensured that logs include necessary context and are appropriately categorized by severity.


## Assignment 07:
• Publish Message to Pub/Sub Topic on User Account Creation
Whenever a new user account is created, the web application publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic. This message contains relevant information in JSON format that will be utilized by a Cloud Function to send an email to the user and track the link verification process.
• The payload (message) published to the Pub/Sub topic includes information as 
Username: The username of the newly created user.
• All API calls from user accounts that have not been verified are now blocked until the user completes the email verification process. (GET/UPDATE api request).

• Email Verification Process
The email verification process involves the following steps:

When a user requests to verify their email, the web application checks the validity of the verification link.
If the link is valid and within the allowed time frame (2 minutes from the current time), the user is marked as isVerified column to true in the database.
If the link is invalid or has expired, appropriate error messages are returned to the user.

• Endpoints
Verify Email Endpoint
Endpoint: /verify-email
Method: GET
Description: Verifies the email address of a user by checking the validity of the verification link.
Parameters:
username: The username of the user requesting email verification.
token: The verification token associated with the user.
Middleware:
Basic Authentication Middleware: Used to authenticate API requests.
Database Connection Middleware: Checks the database connection before processing API requests.
Payload and Query Parameters Middleware: Validates payload and query parameters of API requests.
Response:
200 OK: If the email is successfully verified.
400 Bad Request: If the email verification link is invalid or has expired.
500 Internal Server Error: If there is an internal server error during the verification process

## Assignment 09:

Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions:

This repository contains the GitHub Actions workflow for automating the deployment of my web application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Workflow Overview as part of this assignment:

The GitHub Actions workflow automates the following steps:

1. Generate Random ID: This step generates a random ID to be used for naming the new instance template.

2. Create New Instance Template Version:
    - This step creates a new version of the instance template with the latest machine image ID for the managed instance group.
    - It uses Packer to build a custom image and extracts the image ID from the build output.
    - The image ID is then used to create the new instance template.

3. Start Set and Rolling Update for Managed Instance Group:
    - This step starts a rolling update for the managed instance group using the new instance template.
    - It sets the maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update.

4. Wait for Managed Instance Group Refresh to Complete:
    - This step waits for the managed instance group to reach the target version.
    - It ensures that the GitHub Actions workflow waits until the update process is completed.

Secrets:

This workflow utilizes the following secrets stored in GitHub Actions:
- 'GCP_PROJECT_ID': Google Cloud Platform project ID.
- 'MACHINE_TYPE': Machine type for the new instance template.
- 'REGION': Region where the new instance template and managed instance group reside.
- 'DEVICE_NAME': Name of the device for the disk in the new instance template.
- 'DISK_SIZE': Size of the disk for the new instance template.
- 'DISK_TYPE': Type of the disk for the new instance template.
- 'KEY_NAME': Name of the key for encrypting the disk.
- 'VM_KMS_KEYNAME': Name of the KMS key for encrypting the disk.
- 'TARGET_TAGS_HTTP': Target tags for network traffic.
- 'SCOPES': Scopes for the instance.
- 'SERVICE_ACCOUNT': Service account to be used by the instance.
- 'VPC_NETWORK': VPC network for the instance.
- 'SUBNET': Subnet for the instance.
- 'GROUP_MANAGER_NAME': Name of the managed instance group.


Monitoring Updates:

The workflow ensures that the GitHub Actions workflow waits until the managed instance group refresh is complete.
